	*	This file enables the extruder hotend and the heatbed!
	*	
	*	Which means, at-last you have gotten to the point of printing out
	*	your first test cube. Congrats!
	*
	*	After enabling this file, run through the setup calibration steps
	*		for the hotend extruder, and (when the tests pass) enable the
	*		heatbed.
	*
	*	The heatbed will allow you to print a well-finished part.
